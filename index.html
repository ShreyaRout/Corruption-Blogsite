        <p>Corruption has been a major challenge for India for many years, and the country has been taking several steps to fight it. Various measures have been taken by the government to fight corruption in India. India has enacted several anti-corruption laws, such as the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, and the Whistleblowers Protection Act, among others. These laws aim to deter corruption and provide a legal framework for punishing corrupt officials. The government has been digitising public services such as issuing certificates, licences, and permits, which reduces the scope for corruption by eliminating human interaction and providing transparency in the process. Aadhaar linkage and DBT (direct benefit transfer) are major reforms; with these, about Rs 2.25 lakh crore has been saved from falling into the wrong hands. The government has been encouraging public participation in the fight against corruption by creating awareness campaigns, providing channels for whistleblowers to report corruption, and incentivizing public servants to report corrupt practices. Promoting transparency and accountability in public administration by introducing measures such as the Right to Information Act and the mandatory disclosure of assets by public servants has been achieved. The government has simplified regulatory processes and reduced bureaucratic hurdles, which reduced opportunities for corruption by eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing discretion in decision-making. But the most important thing is the strengthening of investigative agencies. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are two of the main agencies tasked with investigating corruption cases in India. The government has been strengthening these agencies by providing them with the necessary resources and infrastructure to effectively carry out their work. Record seizures by the ED and thousands of FIRs filed by the CBI are a testimony to the resolve of the government to fight corruption. The Modi government has given a free hand to these agencies. From the panchayat level to the highest level is now the jurisdiction of the agencies.</p>

            <h3>Political Corruption: A Global Issue</h3>
            <p>Political corruption is a significant global issue that affects countries worldwide, regardless of their level of development. It involves the misuse of public power and resources for personal gain, leading to a loss of trust in government institutions, weakening of democratic processes, and hindrance to economic and social development.

                <h4>Key Points on Political Corruption:</h4>
                <h5>-Undermines Democracy:</h5> Political corruption erodes democratic values by allowing a few individuals or groups to manipulate political processes for their benefit.
                <h5>- Economic Impact: </h5> It diverts public funds away from essential services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, contributing to poverty and inequality.
                <h5>- Global Presence:</h5> No country is immune to political corruption, although its extent and impact vary. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index provides insight into how countries are perceived in terms of public sector corruption.
                <h5>- Challenges to Governance:</h5> Corruption hinders effective governance, making it difficult to implement policies that promote the common good.
                <h5>- International Efforts: </h5> Global organizations, including the United Nations and the World Bank, advocate for anti-corruption measures and transparency in governance to combat this issue.

            <h3>Corruption Index:India Ranks 93 among 180 ntions.</h3>
            <p>INDIA ranked 93 out of 180 countries on the corruption perceptions index (CPI) for 2023, according to the latest report released by Transparency International. The index, which lists countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, ranked Denmark at the top, followed by Finland, New Zealand and Norway.
                <br>

                The index uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. In 2023, India‚Äôs overall score was 39 while in 2022, it was 40. India‚Äôs rank in 2022 was 85. In the Asian region, Singapore ranked at the top, scoring 83 and occupying the fifth slot.
                <br>
                
                ‚ÄúIndia (39) shows score fluctuations small enough that no firm conclusions can be drawn on any significant change. However, ahead of the elections, India sees further narrowing of civic space, including through the passage of a (telecommunication) Bill that could be a ‚Äògrave threat‚Äô to fundamental rights,‚Äù the report said.
                <br>
                
                While western Europe and the European Union remained the top-scoring regions, its regional average score dropped to 65 this year, as checks and balances weakened and political integrity eroded, the report said.</p>

            <h3>Corporate Scandals and Public Trust</h3>
            <p>Corporate scandals have a profound impact on public trust, often leading to significant consequences for businesses and society. When companies engage in unethical or illegal practices, it can erode confidence in not only the corporation itself but also in the broader business community and regulatory systems.

                <h4>Key Points on Corporate Scandals and Public Trust:</h4>
                <h5>- Erosion of Trust:</h5> Corporate scandals, such as financial fraud, environmental violations, or exploitation of workers, undermine the public's trust in businesses and their leadership.
                <h5>- Reputation Damage:</h5> Companies involved in scandals often suffer long-term damage to their reputation, leading to loss of customers, partners, and investors.
                <h5>- Economic Consequences:</h5> Scandals can lead to stock market declines, loss of market share, and even bankruptcy, affecting not only the company but also employees, shareholders, and the broader economy.
                <h5>- Regulatory Impact:</h5> High-profile corporate scandals often result in stricter regulations and increased oversight to prevent future misconduct, impacting the entire industry.
                <h5>- Restoring Trust:</h5> Rebuilding public trust after a scandal requires transparency, accountability, and a commitment to ethical business practices. Companies must take concrete actions to address the issues and demonstrate a genuine commitment to change.
                Corporate scandals serve as a reminder of the importance of integrity and accountability in business. They highlight the need for strong ethical standards, effective governance, and the role of public scrutiny in maintaining trust in the corporate sector.</p>

            <h3>Here are 10 ways to fight corruption</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
        
                
                
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vx2773eSbec?si=E8yLDVC0RAxZJS-O" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <br>
            <p>1. Corruption is not only about bribes: People especially the poor get hurt when resources are wasted. That‚Äôs why it is so important to understand the different kinds of corruption to develop smart responses. 
                <br>
                <br>
 
                2. Power of the people: Create pathways that give citizens relevant tools to engage and participate in their governments ‚Äì identify priorities,  problems and find solutions.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                3. Cut the red tape: Bring together formal and informal processes (this means working with the government as well as  non-governmental groups) to change behavior and monitor progress.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                4. It‚Äôs not 1999: Use the power of technology to build dynamic and continuous exchanges between key stakeholders: government, citizens, business, civil society groups, media, academia etc.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                5. Deliver the goods: Invest in institutions and policy ‚Äì sustainable improvement in how a government delivers services is only possible if the people in these institutions endorse sensible rules and practices that allow for change while making the best use of tested traditions and legacies ‚Äì imported models often do not work.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                6. Get incentives right: Align anti-corruption measures with market, behavioral, and social forces. Adopting integrity standards is a smart business decision, especially for companies interested in doing business with the World Bank Group and other development partners.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                7. Sanctions matter: Punishing corruption is a vital component of any effective anti-corruption effort.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                8. Act globally and locally: Keep citizens engaged on corruption at local, national, international and global levels ‚Äì in line with the scale and scope of corruption. Make use of the architecture that has been developed and the platforms that exist for engagement.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                9. Build capacity for those who need it most: Countries that  suffer from chronic fragility, conflict and violence‚Äì are often the ones that have the fewest internal resources to combat corruption. Identify ways to leverage international resources to support and sustain good governance.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                10. Learn by doing: Any good  strategy must be continually monitored  and evaluated to make sure it can be easily adapted as  situations on the ground change.</p>
